                 <h1><u>Electronics:</u></h1>
            <p> Electronics is a subfield within the wider electrical engineering academic subject.
            An academic degree with a major in electronics engineering can be acquired from some universities,
            while other universities use electrical engineering as the subject.
            The term electrical engineer is still used in the academic world to include electronic engineers.
            [1] However, some believe the term electrical engineer should be reserved for those having specialized in power and heavy current or high voltage engineering,
            while others consider that power is just one subset of electrical engineering similar to electric power distribution engineering.
            The term power engineering is used as a descriptor in that industry.
            Again, in recent years there has been a growth of new separate-entry degree courses such as systems engineering and communication systems engineering,
            often followed by academic departments of similar name,
            which are typically not considered as subfields of electronics engineering but of electrical engineering </p>

            <p>Electronic engineering (also called electronics and communications engineering)
            is an electrical engineering discipline which utilizes nonlinear and active electrical components
            (such as semiconductor devices, especially transistors and diodes) to design electronic circuits,
            devices, integrated circuits and their systems.
            The discipline typically also designs passive electrical components,
            usually based on printed circuit boards</p>
